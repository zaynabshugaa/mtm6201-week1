        <p> Zaynab Shuga'a is my name. I'm 18 years old and in my first year of the Interactive Media Design program at Algqonuin College. I've always loved art and design, so after I graduated from high school, I chose to enroll in the Interactive Media Design program. I am a really sociable, fun, and open-minded person that is always willing to try something new. I like to draw, play video games, travel, and hang out with my friends and family, who are my greatest sources of motivation.</p>
        <p>I hope to finish my study in the IMD program and move onto the Animation program at Algonquin. Although, I still do not have a clear idea of what I want to be once I finish school, I have big plans formyself. </p>
